//adding few new properties like -> City : 'Australia' & -> 2020 : 'Best Year'

//incrementing employeeAge value by 1
console.log('Initial Age: ', employee.employeeAge)

// when user gives input then also use [] to fetch data

let userInput = 'employeeName'
console.log(employee.userInput) // error, says undefined, hence using []
console.log(employee[userInput])
