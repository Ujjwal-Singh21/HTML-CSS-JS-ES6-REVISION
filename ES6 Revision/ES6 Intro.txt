Introduction to ES6 :-
========================

1) JavaScript is a superset of ECMAScript scripting language(ES6).

2) ECMAScript forms the language base for JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript.

3) ES6 gives a vast makeover to JavaScript by adding new syntaxes and APIs to write complex applications and libraries that are easier to debug and maintain.

Why ECMAScript 6 ?
==================

1) JavaScript is extremely powerful and flexible, but it is often criticized for having unnecessary redundancy.

2) JavaScript developers often use abstractions such as CoffeeScript and Typescript, which provide easier
syntax, powerful features, and compile to JavaScript.

3) ES6 was introduced to improve JavaScript and ensure that developers no longer needed  to use abstractions or other techniques to write quality code, which leads to a lengthy process.

History and More Information of ES6 :-
========================================
1) ECMAScript is a scripting language standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. Scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript are supersets of ECMAScript. 

Although JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript have more capabilities than ECMAScript, by defining more objects and methods, the core features of these languages are the same as ECMAScript.

2) ECMAScript 6 is the sixth version and the seventh edition of the ECMAScript language. In short, it is also called "ES6".

3) JavaScript was lacking behind some other programming languages when compared to various syntactic forms such as :-

   a) declaring constant variables, 
   b) declaring block scoped variables,
   c) extracting data from arrays, 
   d) shorter syntax for declaring functions and so on. 

   ES6 adds up a lot of new syntax-based features to JavaScript, which helps the developers to write less and do more. 

   ES6 also prevents programmers from using various hacks for achieving various goals, which have negative performance impact and made code harder to read. 

Summary :-
=============
1) ECMAScript 2015 is the sixth version and the seventh edition of the ECMAScript language. In short, it is also called "ES6".

2) ES6 adds up a lot of new syntax-based features to JavaScript, which helps the developers to write less and do more.

3) Google Chrome and Opera supports most of the ES6 features.

4) In the production environment, It is recommended to use node compiler like babel, traceur and TypeScript to compile and embed the compiled JS.
