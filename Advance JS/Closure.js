//When we return an inner function from an Outer function, a combination of 2 things gets returned, 
//those 2 things are: 1) the inner function itself 2) the lexical scope of inner function which has 
//references to its surrounding state (means reference to the scope of its Parent function also).

function outerFn () {
  var count = 25

  function innerFn () {
    ++count
    console.log('Counter:', count)
  }

  return innerFn
}

const returnedFn = outerFn()

returnedFn() //26 -> hence it remembers the count value from its parent function scope even after its 
// parent execution has totally completed above, also new count value is 26 now.

returnedFn() //27 -> because last count value the function remembers is 26.
